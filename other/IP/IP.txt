 // IP

==============================================================================

// The Internet Protocol (IP) 
    - is the method for sending data from one computer to another over the internet.

============================================================================== Router

- A router connects networks 

==============================================================================

IP addresses can be converted to binary:
Address:   126.0.0.0 
Address (binary): 01111110.00000000.00000000.00000000



IP as 4 octets (numbers separated by the dots): "1.2.3.4"


IP number identifies its Network, and its host (devise/machine)
172.16.0.1  
- the [172.16] is the network address
- the [0.1] is the host address




// IP class
defines which part of the IP address to use to identify the network,
and which part to use to identify hosts 


// network class 
based on how many hosts it can have.
example: 
    - class A -> has more hosts, 
    - class C -> has less hosts, 


============================================================================== IP classes 

IP class A (for devices) - small number of class A networks 
        - network address are first octet - in "126.0.0.0"  it is "126" 
        - starts with binary number "0" (when the IP is converted to binary) --> 00000001.00000000.00000000.00000000 ?
        - 1.2.3.4 "1" is network address, "2.3.4" is host address 
        - 126 networks
        - ~16M hosts
        - range: 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0
        - default subnet mask:  255.0.0.0
        - Class A IP address format is thus: 0NNNNNNN.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH

- The IP range 127.x.x.x is reserved for loopback IP addresses.

IP class B (for devises) 
        - network address are first 2 octets - in "172.16.0.1"  it is "172.16" 
        - starts with binary number "10"  (when the IP is converted to binary) --> 10000000.00000000.00000000.00000000 ?
        - network count: 16384
        - host count: 65534
        - range: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0
        - The default subnet mask for Class B is 255.255.x.x.
        - IP address format is: 10NNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.HHHHHHHH.HHHHHHHH

IP class C (for devices)
        - network address is the first 3 octets - in "223.255.255.0"  it is "223.255" 
        - starts with binary number "110" (when the IP is converted to binary) --> 11000000.00000000.00000000.00000000 ?
        - network count: 2097152
        - host count: 254
        - range: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0
        - The default subnet mask for Class C is 255.255.255.x.
        - Class C IP address format is: 110NNNNN.NNNNNNNN.NNNNNNNN.HHHHHHHH

IP class D (for multicast) 
        - In multicasting data is not destined for a particular host
        - range: 224.0.0.0 â€“ 239.255.255.255
        - starts with binary number "1110"  (when the IP is converted to binary) --> 11101111.00000000.00000000.00000000 ?

IP class E (reserved, for experimental purposes only)
        - range: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.254

============================================================================== Subnet masks

- it is used to identify which part of the IP is for the network and which part of the IP is for the host


class A - 255.0.0.0 -- itendifies that the first octet of an IP is used to identify the network
class B - 255.255.0.0 -- itendifies that the first two octet of an IP is used to identify the network
class C - 255.255.255.0 -- itendifies that the first three octet of an IP is used to identify the network


benefit of subnet masking: break a large network into smaller ones


CIDR: classless interdomain routing

CIDR notation: 172.16.1.0/24  ->  first 24 bits are 1 for mask -> 11111111.11111111.11111111 .00000000


".../8"     --> binary mask: 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000
".../16"    --> binary mask: 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000
".../24"    --> binary mask: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

// Not the same network: (because of the CIDR notation)
// in this case, the CIDR notation of ".../24" makes the first 3 octets of the IP be reserved for the network address
172.16.0.0/24
172.16.1.0/24

============================================================================== Subnet (Subnetwork)

// Example of subnetwork:  original network was (128.0.x.x)
// but with subnetwork: the network address is now (128.0.1.x, 128.0.2.x, 128.0.3.x)
- 128.0.1.100
- 128.0.1.101
- 128.0.1.102

- 128.0.2.103
- 128.0.2.104
- 128.0.2.105

- 128.0.3.106
- 128.0.3.107
- 128.0.3.108



- Organizations will use a subnet to subdivide large networks into smaller
- One goal of a subnet is to split a large network into a grouping of smaller, interconnected networks to help minimize traffic

- Devices in same subnet must be in same IP network
        - IF they are in different networks: They will not be able to comunicate !!!

============================================================================== NAT 

- NAT: network address translation 
        - maps many internal IPs and presents it to the internet as 1 IP (the router's IP), and vice-versa

============================================================================== Supernetting

- We can join networks, also called supernetting !

==============================================================================

A broadcast address is an IP address that is used to target all systems on a specific subnet network instead of single hosts. In other words broadcast address allows information to be sent to all machines on a given subnet rather than to a specific machine.
