TLS / SSL

1. Browser requests a secure page (HTTPS) from the server
2. Server sends public key with SSL certificate (that is signed by the CA)
3. Browser checks the certificate signature from the server against the CA's public key 
3.1 Once checked, a green padlock appears in the top left corner of the browser
4. Browser creates symetric keys, and encrypts it (using servers public key), and sends one of the symetric keys to the server.
5. Server uses its private key to decrypt and get the browser's symetric key 
6. Now all traffic between the browser and the server will be encrypted and decrypted with the same symetric key 

Green padlock: It only indicates that the communication is encrypted, hackers can get SSL certificates for their websites as well
Symetric key: shared keys, same two keys 
Asymetric key: there are two keys, public key and private key. private key encrypts data, and public key decrypts data
    - It can work the other way arround also.

Why SSL handshake?

Ssl was introduced for transport level security.. to protect data in transit.. 

There are 2 types : 1 way and 2 way. 

1 way is client verifies server .. 

2 way is both verify each other. This is done by exchanging public certs and matching them with the private key that is not shared
