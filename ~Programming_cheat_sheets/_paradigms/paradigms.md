# Paradigms

* Many Languages supports more than one programming paradigm.

###### Object Oriented Programing

Data and methods to manipulate the data are kept as one unit called an object.
Uses Classes and objects to model real world objects
Example: Java, Ruby, PHP, Python, C#, C++, Swift, Objective-c
```

###### Procedural
```
Describes step by step the procedures to solve a problem
It groups code into functions
Examples: C, Fortran, Cobol
```

###### Functional
```
Programs are treated as mathematical functions, with input and output
It disallowes side effects
Examples: Lisp, Haskell, F#
```
