Today I hit an infinite loop in a React component 😅

You can stop infinite loops in chrome without force-closing the program in two ways:

One: Dev Tools

Dev tools (if not already open, go View -> Developer -> Developer Tools)
Sources tab
Press the Pause icon ⏸ near the top right of the Sources panel
Use method two if you can’t open dev tools.

Press the three vertical dots in the top right corner of Chrome
Hover over “More tools...” near the mid-bottom
Press “Task Manager”
Select the tab you are experiencing the loop in
Hit “End Process”
Hopefully this can help someone!
