     * http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/creating-custom-angularjs-directives-part-2-isolate-scope
     * 
     * 
     * The directive scope:
     *  - scope: true  ->  The directive gets a new scope, the parent's scope DOES affect the directive's scope
     *                     but the directive's scope does not affect the parent's scope.
     *  - scope: false ->  The directive shares the parent's scope! they are mutually affected.
     * 
     * - scope: {}     ->  The directive gets a NEW and ISOLATED scope, the scope does not inherite the parent scope properties
     *                     It is a completely isolated scope.
     *                     BUT, the scope can access data from the HTML attributes.
     * - scope: {
     *       foo: '=', // this is for two-way data binding!  
     *       bar: '@', // this is for one-way data binding! and it only accepts primitive values ??? 
     *       baz: '&', // this is for functions 
     *   }
     * 
     * - the use of `scope.apply()`  -> When you are inside a callback that does not belong to Angular, but to a 3rd party library, 
     *                                  you can call this function to update the bound variables!
