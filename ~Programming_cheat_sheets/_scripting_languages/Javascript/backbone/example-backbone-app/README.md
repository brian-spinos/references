#Example Backbone.js App

##try it out here...
<http://dperrymorrow.github.com/example-backbone-app/>

As simple as possible backbone.js app to demonstrate how to wire one up. Does not even have a serverside, just persists full crud clientside with the server calls commented out.
It lets you create, read, update, delete notes, all with hashtag urls via a Backbone.js router.
