###### Step definitions
```ruby
# myApp/features/step_definitions/my_steps.rb

Given /^I have users named (.+)$/ do |names|
  names.split(', ').each do |name|
    User.create!(name: name)
  end
end

Given /^I have no users$/ do
  User.delete_all
end

Then /^I should have ([0-9]+) users?$/ do |count|
  User.count.should == count.to_i
end


#---------- By Brian

When(/^I go to the list of users$/) do
  visit users_path
end



Then(/^I should see "([^"]*)"$/) do |arg1|
  # page.html.should =~ /#{arg1}/
  expect(page).to have_content(arg1)
end

# Given(/^I am on the "([^"]*)"$/) do |arg1|
#   visit path_to arg1
# end

Given(/^I am on the list of new users$/) do
  visit new_user_path
end

When(/^I follow "([^"]*)"$/) do |arg1|
  path_to arg1
end

When(/^I fill in "([^"]*)" with "([^"]*)"$/) do |arg1, arg2|
  # puts page.body # for debugging!
  fill_in arg1, with: arg2
end

When(/^I press "([^"]*)"$/) do |arg1|
  click_button arg1
end
```



###### Support
```ruby
# myApp/features/support/my_support.rb

module MyModule
def path_to(page_name)
  case page_name

  when /the homepage/
    root_path
  when /the list of users/
    users_path

  when /the list of new users/
    users_path

  when /New User/
    new_user_path

###### The actual test
```gherkin
# myApp/features/my_test.feature

Feature: Manage Users
  In order to make a blog
  As an author
  I want to create and manage users

  Scenario: Users List
    Given I have users named Brian, Erich
    When I go to the list of users
    Then I should see "Brian"
    And I should see "Erich"

  # use this on top of the feature key-word if you need
  # to open the browser and test javascript
  @javascript
  Scenario: create user
    Given I am on the list of new users
    When I fill in "Name" with "Dude"
    And I fill in "Email" with "dude@example.com"
    And I fill in "Address" with "345 Foobar St"
    And I press "Create User"
    Then I should see "User was successfully created."
    And I should see "Dude"
    And I should see "dude@example.com"
    And I should see "345 Foobar St"
    And I should have 1 user    
```



```bash
# run cucumber tests:

# The -s option is to hide the steps definition location
# use bundle exec, or else it could raise some errors
bundle exec cucumber -s

```

###### Grid example
```gherkin
Feature: Signing in
  In order to use the app
  As a user
  I want to sign in

  Scenario: create user
    Given I am on the home page
