###### about programing languages

```
variables - are used to store data. example name = 'brian'
functions - are reusable chuncks code that does what you want. example:  save_user_to_database
classes - are reusable chuncks of variables and functions grouped together
objects - they are created using a 'class'. example: 'ferrari' is an object created with a 'car' class.


getter function - is a function that gets a value
setter function - is a function that sets a value

argument, parameters - is data that you pass to your function so the function can work with that data
callback function - is a function passed as a parameter to another function


inheritance - when a class gets variables and functions from another class

instance - its what is created with a class, the same as the 'object'

instance variables - its variables that belong only to an instance ('object')
instance functions - its functions that belong only to an instance ('object')

class variables - its variables that belong only to a class 
class functions - its functions that belong only to an class 

Parameter - A parameter is a variable in a method definition
Argument - arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters.
Instantiation - the act of creating an object by using a class
Declaration - informing the computer that you will be using a variable or function
Closure - a function that has variables attached to it, even if these variables are not in scope
Scope - a group of variables and functions available to you at a specific part of your code
modularity - creating groups of code that are independent of each other, but can work together
pass by reference - passing the actual variable
pass by value -  passing a copy of the variable
function, method, routine, action - a chunck of code grouped together to be reused
variable, field, column, attribute, member - a caontainer for a value
namespace - a container for code, so you can separate it from other code
constructor - the function in the class that is called when the object is instantiated
destructor - the function in the class that is called when the object is deleted, or goes out out of scope
cache - a temporary storage place in the computer's memory for any data, a simple array could be used
