// Redis
Sidekiq works closely with Redis 4.0+ to organize job queues and store statistics. Redis (stands for Remote Dictionary Server) 
is a fast open source in-memory key-value data store (Database). 
It provides sub-millisecond response times and allows real-time applications to run millions of requests per second. 
In other words Redis is a database, a key-value store.


// To install redis:

or
