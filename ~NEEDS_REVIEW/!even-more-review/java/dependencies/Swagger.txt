Swagger


swagger.io


swagger has several tools

you can generate Java, and Typescript from swagger ??? the APIS ??? wow ???
I have seen it generate JSON swagger code from Java and annotations…
and it generates the HTML views for swagger inside your java app

swagger has annotations for Java rest classes, like BookEndpoint:
@SwaggerDefinition(…)

@ApiOperation(…)
@ApiResponses(…)
@ApiResponse(…)
@ApiModel(…)




io.swagger
swagger-annotations
1.5.13



Swagger is the old name
It is now called OpenAPI

contract: a REST API documentation - JSON document


OAS: OpenAPI specification - JSON document

It generates a dashboard with REST capability ?


editor.swagger.io

The swagger spec file can be generated from annotations in your source code

 You need swaggerUI (or APIgee?) to parse the swagger spec file and generate a dashboard
swagger.io/swagger-ui/


petstore.swagger.io

You can download the swagger dashboard app source code at GitHub, it’s basically html css and js ?
