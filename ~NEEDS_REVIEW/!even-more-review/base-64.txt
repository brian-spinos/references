Base64

- Why base64 encoding?
    - used when we are limited to transfer ASCII data
      And we need to transfer images, files, etc (any binary data)

    - To transform binary data to text data
        - Example: you want to store binary data in XML, what if the binary has caracters like ></ ??? It will break the XML, 
          so we need to encode in base64 - only letters and numbers :)
    - Because networks only send in 7 bits ???
      Since data is encoded in 8 bits,
      Base64 converts data to 6 bits
          The way it does it is: 
          Takes 3 bytes, and turns it into 4 pieces of 6 bit information.

--------------------------------------
- Takes every 6 bits of a binary data (everything is binary, really) 
  and maps to one of the 64 charactes of base64:
      A-Z
      a-z
      0-9
      +
      /
      =
