Why base64 encoding



-> To transform binary data to text data

Example: u want to store binary data in XML, what if the binary has caracters like ></ ??? It will break the XML, so we need to encode in base64 - only letters and numbers :)


Because networks only send in 7 bits ???

Since data is encoded in 8 bits,
Base64 converts data to 6 bits

The way it does it is: 
Takes 3 bytes, and turns it into 4 pieces of 6 bit information.

=======

- takes every 6 bits of a binary data (everything is binary, really) and maps to one of the
64 charactes of base64
- used when we are limited to transfer ASCII data
  And we need to transfer images, files, etc (any binary data)
