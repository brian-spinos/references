GIT

# create a branch based on an existing branch:
$ git checkout -b my-feature master

# checkout remote branch
$ ...


# Find lost commits
$ ...


# undo a commit reset?





git diff —staged # diff of added files compared to HEAD

git reset HEAD foo.txt # remove file from index/staging 

git checkout — foo.txt # blow away changes, make it like the file in HEAD

git reset —soft HEAD^ # if you regret a commit, it undoes the commit, brings back files to staging! Nice
