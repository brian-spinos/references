JIT

The JIT compiler is enabled by default, and is activated when a Java method is called. 
The JIT compiler compiles the bytecode of that method into native machine code, compiling
 it "just in time" to run. When a method has been compiled, the JVM calls the compiled code 
 of that method directly instead of interpreting it.
