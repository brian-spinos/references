Wifi, cellphones use FM, so it transmits binary as:
Zeros: high frequencies
Ones: low frequencies
The amplitude stays the same.



AM - amplitude modulation
FM - frequency modulation


Big waves can go through walls


Amplitude - height of a wave, volume, loudness


Wavelength - length of wave, pitch, color, speed, frquency
