# GRASP

###### Very good resource
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design)

###### Patterns

- controller (from mvc pattern)
- creator (factory pattern)
- indirection (have an object in the middle)
- information expert (put methods in the best possible class)
- high cohesion (obj is highly focused)
- low coupling (dont depend on other objects)
- polymorphism
- protected variations
- pure fabrication (if there is no class to add a behavior, create a wrapper class for it)
