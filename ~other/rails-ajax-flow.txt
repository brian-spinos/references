Ajax flow

In the controller index, set variables, and do stuff

In the view, you have access to controller variables, have a form with remote: true, this form will now be submitted as ajax request, and it will go o the controller to the action it is sent to...

Back in the controller, in the other action, it will execute your action code, you can receive the params, you need a respond_to block with format.js and the controller will send you to the corresponding js view.


In the js view, you have access to variables from the controllers action, here you should update the page with new information!!!

$("<%= escape_javascript(render @user) %>").appendTo("#users");



escape_javascript: Escapes carriage returns and single and double quotes for JavaScript segments.
