Config file: Dockerfile



Dockerfile -> image -> container -> image


Add files to your image, code also

Containers don’t persist data, nor new files
The solution is: data volumes, it exposes files in your local machine to a container , the files could be code or database

When writing code, have it in a folder in your local machine and expose it as a volume to your container, that way, you can edit your code in your local machine or in your container, and the new code will not be lost!!!

-p hostPort:containerPort 


-v hostFilder:containerFolder



———- commands

# run container
$ docker container run -it —name foo ubuntu 


$ docker network ls
$ docker network create blog # ???
