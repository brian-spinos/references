Dijkstras - find the shortest distance betwen all vertices to source:

1. Use a minHeap
2. The nodes need to have a 'distance' property/field
3. Assing 'INFINITY' to the 'distance' property/field of all nodes, 
   and the SOURCE node to start assign ZERO to the 'distance' property/field
4. Use two arrays for 'visited' and 'unvisited' nodes
5. Get the first node of the 'unvisited' array and add it to the 'visited' array
6. Update the 'distance' property/field of the NEIGHBOR nodes of the CURRENT node to 
   the sum of the CURRENT node's 'distance' property/field plus the neighbor's 'distance' property/field IF 
   the neighbor's 'distance' property/field is grater then the result.   
   (each current node will have many neighbours)
