browser-sync

You need node.js

$ npm install -g browser-sync


It has an executable to run a browser-sync server, that watches for changes in your code.

If you are already using a server, like apache with PHP, you can use browser-sync as a proxy between the browser and apache/PHP

$ browser-sync start
—proxy “localhost:8080” #your existing server
—files “*”
# the default url for browser-sync server is localhost:3000 

Browser —> 
browser-sync server (localhost:3000) —> apache/PHP server (localhost:8080)


It makes an IP available to your phone! Cool!
