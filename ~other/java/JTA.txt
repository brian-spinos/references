JTA


javax.transaction jta 1.1
session.beginTransaction();
session.save(user);
session.getTransaction().commit();
session.close();

Group queries together as a single unit! Rollback capability!

Transactions between multiple hosts
Could be DB transactions 

EJBs can do this?

@Transactional
public class BookService{}
