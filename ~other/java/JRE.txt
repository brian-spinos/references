JRE - JVM + libraries(jars), you need JRE just for running code, not developing code (JRE is the implementation of the JVM) (JRE physically exists)



JRE : it is used to run the bytecode produced by the jdk (using the JVM?),
It contains the libraries that come with java


Inside it: it contains the JVM


Interesting: you cant do any java development with the JRE alone, you would need the JDK
