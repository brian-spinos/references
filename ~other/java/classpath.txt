It is an env var:
CLASSPATH 

export CLASSPATH=/foo/aaa.jar:/bbb/ccc/:. # not tested

that contains a list of folders where my code is and jars that I want to access
  


A classpath is also the directories where you put 
your java classes and jar files, it is also an 
environment variable


$ javac MyMainClass.java
$ java -cp foo.jar:. MyMainClass 
# jar file is in the same directory as my class


/src/main/resources - is included in the classpath by default
