CORS
Cross origin resource sharing

The server is the one who decides which domains can access its data!

There are browser plugins to enable CORS (chrome ‘CORS’ plugin), the plugin adds a “Access-Control-Allow-Origin”: “*”
But this is a security issue, because any javascript is allowed 


By default foo.com can only make ajax requests to foo.com and NOT bar.com

// these are different domains:
foo.com:3000
foo.com:4000


preflight check: browser checks if we can get data from the other server, in the form of an OPTIONS request


========== Server side:
Cors is disabled by default (will not share)

// bar.com, the server, should send these to 
// allow foo.com, the client, to consume it.

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ‘http://the-client.com’
Access-Control-Allow-Methods : ‘GET, POST’
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: ‘Content-Type’
